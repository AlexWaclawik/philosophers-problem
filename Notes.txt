
Done:
	makefile is done and should work but wouldn't be bad to take a look at it and see if im forgetting anything

Nearly Done:
	the philosopher.h and .cpp are mostly lined out there are comments were I have not finished
	the runner.h and .cpp are mostly lined out there are comments wehre I have not finished things
	the Mailbox.h and .cpp were brought over from Project 3 don't know if they work or need to be changed
	mailbox is done


Has psuedoCode:
	Changer.cpp and .h aren't but have pseudocode comments
	main.cpp is literally just initializiing the philsophers and ending them at a certain point


	just looked at the paper and it says that this needs to be able to hadle various graphs including the classical 5 philosophers and more complex ones with various numbers of forks for each one
	this means taht we need to implement a text file reader
